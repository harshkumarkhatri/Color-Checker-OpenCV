# Color Checking Using OpenCV
This is a project which i have build while learning opencv.<br>
It contains two files.<br>
#### main.py file
It has the code with the help of which all the frames turn out to be black except for the colored frame which which we have specified the color for.
#### colors.py file
It has the code opposite to that of main.py file i.e. all the pixels in the frame will have their original color except for the color which we have specified. That will turn out to be black.
